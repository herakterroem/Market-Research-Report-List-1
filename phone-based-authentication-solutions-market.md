<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phone-based Authentication Solutions Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Factor Certification</li><li>Multifactor Certification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phone-based authentication solutions encompass Single Factor Certification and Multifactor Certification. Single Factor Certification relies on one method of authentication, typically a one-time password (OTP) sent via SMS or a call, making it simpler but less secure. In contrast, Multifactor Certification combines two or more methods, such as OTPs alongside biometric verification or security questions, enhancing security by requiring multiple proofs of identity. This layered approach better protects against unauthorized access, addressing growing security concerns in the digital landscape.</p></p>

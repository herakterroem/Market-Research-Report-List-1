<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Benzol-hydro-refining Unit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low-Temperature Hydrogenation Units</li><li>High-Temperature Hydrogenation Units</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Benzol-hydro-refining unit market comprises mainly two types: low-temperature hydrogenation units and high-temperature hydrogenation units. Low-temperature hydrogenation units operate at temperatures typically below 200°C and are designed to selectively remove impurities from benzene, improving purity while minimizing by-product formation. In contrast, high-temperature hydrogenation units function at elevated temperatures, above 200°C, allowing for more aggressive treatment of feedstock, resulting in a higher yield of refined products but potentially producing more by-products. Both units are essential in petrochemical refining processes.</p></p>
